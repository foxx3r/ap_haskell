# ap_haskell
I've just made an algorithm that calculates AP (Arithmetic Progression), it was made in haskell. A curious fact is that, I've created that algorithm to be helpful for me while learning F# and Haskell

To test the script, type `ghci`, then, on the Prelude, import the file with `:l ap.hs`, and finally, type:

`ap <list> <index>`
